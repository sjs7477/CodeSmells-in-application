Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
37_MvvmArchitecture-master,com.mythmayor.mvvmarchitecture,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: com.mythmayor.mvvmarchitecture; com.mythmayor.mvvmarchitecture.base; com.mythmayor.mvvmarchitecture.utils
37_MvvmArchitecture-master,com.mythmayor.mvvmarchitecture,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): com.mythmayor.mvvmarchitecture.base
37_MvvmArchitecture-master,com.mythmayor.mvvmarchitecture.base,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency.
