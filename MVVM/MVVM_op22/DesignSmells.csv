7_NeedforSpear-master,tr.edu.ku.devnull.needforspear.Viewmodel.GameLogicHandlers,MovementHandler,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
7_NeedforSpear-master,tr.edu.ku.devnull.needforspear.Viewmodel.State,ActivationViewState,Cyclically-dependent Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: ValidateAndChangePasswordViewState; LoginViewState; ActivationViewState; SendVerificationViewState
7_NeedforSpear-master,tr.edu.ku.devnull.needforspear.Viewmodel.State,GameViewState,Cyclically-dependent Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: HelpViewState; MainMenuViewState; GameViewState
7_NeedforSpear-master,tr.edu.ku.devnull.needforspear.Viewmodel.State,InitialState,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
